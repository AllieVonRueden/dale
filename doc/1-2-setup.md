# Dale

[Previous](./1-1-introduction.md) | [Next](./1-3-types.md)

## 1.2 Setup

The Dale compiler is written in C++. It does not depend on any C++11
features, so most versions of clang/gcc should suffice.

### External dependencies

  * LLVM (3.2-3.5)
  * libffi

### Tested platforms

  * Linux (Debian), x86 and x86-64

### Building

From the 'dale' directory, for an out-of-tree (recommended) build:

        mkdir ../build
        cd ../build
        cmake ../dale
        make
        make tests
        make install
    
cmake needs to know the location of the ffi.h header. If this isn't
found in a default location, then it has to be provided during the
third step: e.g.

        cmake ../dale -DFFI_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/

By default, the installation prefix is `/usr/local/`. The compiler
executable (`dalec`) is installed to `/usr/local/bin`, its manpage is
installed to `/usr/local/share/man`, and all libraries are installed
to `/usr/local/lib/dale`.

The tests are written using Perl. `IPC::Run` is the only non-core
dependency required for testing: it can be installed by running `cpan
IPC::Run`, or by way of the system package manager.

### Hello world

Copy the following into a file called `hello-world.dt`:

        (import cstdio)
    
        (def main (fn extern-c int (void)
          (printf "Hello, world\n")))
    
Compile it and run it:

        user@main:~$ dalec hello-world.dt
        user@main:~$ ./a.out
        Hello, world
        user@main:~$

The compiler manpage has more detail on supported flags, but most
things are as per other languages' compilers (`-c`, `-o`, etc.).
